"# TwoGenerals" 
//the problem states that two generals try to comunicate through a non trustable road to engage a coordinated attack.
//we decided that the one generalshould be the lider and send a messenger with the message "we will sound thehorn at x hours"
//the second general recieves such message and responds with "message recieved". if the first general does recieve the confirmation, he will sound the horn, if not, he will not sound the horn.
//client will be the first general and server will be the second general
